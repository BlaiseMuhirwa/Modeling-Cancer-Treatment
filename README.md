# Modeling-Cancer-Treatment

This Project reports my summer research on the effect of dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in cancer treatment)
on the effectiveness of cis-platin (a popular chemotheraphy drug) on patients with Head and Neck Cancer(HNSCC). 
Research Purpose: 
  1. To investigate whether NR3C1 activation by dexamethasone increases resistance to chemotherapy
  2. To train a neural network (CNN) to segregate between high NR3C1 gene expression from low using the
      Xception architecture for informing chemotherapy optimization. 
 
 Result: I observed a statistically significant difference between the effectiveness of cis-platin 
         on patients who were treated with dexamethasone prior to administering chemotherapy versus
         those who were not (with a p-value of 0.015). In particular, dexamethasone appears to counteract cis-platin in HNSCC. 
         
Notice: The data used for patients in clinical trials is not declosed for confidentiality purposes.
